    /*
        audioTagRef.current.play(); - this will throw an error: "Uncaught (in promise) DOMException"
        read this article: 'Autoplay Policy Changes' in Google Developers :)
        (async function() {
        const play = await audioTagRef.current.play();
        })(); also doesn't work.
        You should always look at the Promise returned by the play function to see if it was rejected:
    */
    var promise = audioTagRef.current.play();
    if (promise !== undefined) {
      promise
        .then(_ => {
          // Play initiated!
        })
        .catch(error => {
          // Play was prevented.
          // Show a "Play" button so that user can start playback.
        });
    }
  }, [playerSource]);
  return (
    <audio controls ref={audioTagRef}>
      <source src={`${playerSource.preview_url}`} type='audio/mpeg' />
    </audio>
  );
};

export default Player;
